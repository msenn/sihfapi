# sihfapi
An R package that provides a simple wrapper for the data API of the Swiss Ice Hockey Federation (SIHF). See `vignettes/sihfapi.Rmd` for an introduction into how to retrieve data using the package and how to parse data.

Note that I am not affiliated with SIHF and do not own SIHF API or the data provided therein.
