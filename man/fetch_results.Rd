\item{filter}{Named vector of fields and values to filter query on. SIHF
  requires filter. Details on supported filtering options are unknown. Known
  options include \itemize{ \item{Season (e.g. "2017"); this filter appears
  to be required} \item{Date (e.g. "06.04.2017" or "01.09.2016-05.03.2018")}
  \item{League (e.g. "1" for National League )} \item{Phase (e.g. "2443", key
  not fully understood)} }.

  current season (new season starts being returned from July).}
